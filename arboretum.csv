And the land care crew is beaming with gratitude! Seeds include hyssop, bottlebrush grass, butterfly-weed, and purple Joe-Pye-weed. Land care staff has also collected about 240 pounds of seed from restoration areas. Seed will be combined into mixes and spread before snow falls. Restoring an area like Teal Pond Wetlands or the Lost City can take years of sustained effort, and donations like this are essential for success and priceless for a healthy ecosystem and visitor enjoyment.

🍁✨The artists William Grant Turnbull @paradigmforge and Laura Richards are designing in the studio this week for their upcoming project, “Canopy Understories”. Once completed, the sculptures will be on view later this year at the @uwarboretum 

🍃✨ In their artistic process, the artists use a broad survey of scanned herbarium specimens to gauge the variations in the growth pattern and venation in a given species. 

🍂✨They digitally enhance their scans to study the numerical relationships and angular branching patterns of the veins. The composited design builds a completely new leaf, that was ‘grown’ by the averages of the different specimens. 

🌿Stay tuned for more behind the scenes looks of the upcoming “Canopy Understories” project!

The first phase is removing dense growth of the nonnative shrubs and vines buckthorn, honeysuckle, and bittersweet. We use a large skid-steer with a forestry mower attachment and do this work when the ground is frozen to minimize soil disturbance. You may see this work and its results in a 10-acre area of the Lost City east of Teal Pond and in a 12- to 15-acre area in the Grady Tract. Removing invasive species opens the understory and allows more sunlight to reach the ground. We will use prescribed fire and add seed to help regenerate native savanna wildflowers, grasses, and oaks. Restoration also provides habitat for wildlife, including species of concern such as the redheaded woodpecker. Photos: 1.

There is an Asiatic lilac variety called ‘Bloomerang’ that reblooms later in the season, but when common lilacs rebloom at this time of year they are reacting to drought stress.

Bumble bees have an annual life cycle, and the gynes—future queens—that emerge in late summer are the only bees in a colony to survive until the next spring. They feed briefly and mate, then dig into loose soil to overwinter. Does your garden have late summer and early fall flowers to support them? In these two photos, taken at the same location, RPBB gynes forage on pasture thistle (Cirsium discolor). One was taken on August 29, 2018 (by Susan Carpenter), the other on August 29, 2020 (by volunteer Judy Cardin). Perhaps they are grandmother and granddaughter!",,,,-1.09,Album_Video

In order to understand and protect species it is important to monitor and track their migrations. @journeynorthorg is a citizen science platform that relies on community members to help track these species.  Community members contribute to over 50,000 sightings per year! And this amazing organization is located at the UW-Arboretum (way to go Madison!). Head to your yard, patio, or local park to look for some of the species they monitor. Then head to their website to report your sighting! Take a picture outside, or of your computer, post it, and tag us @PartyforthePlant.Wi for one (1) prize entry!  Check out journeynorth.org for more information. #partyfortheplanetwi",,,,-2.82,Photo

The cold may damage those just opening, and we hope there will be little damage to those not yet flowering. So the good news is that about 40% of the collection still has potential to bloom after Saturday’s weather. 
Cherries have only a light bloom this year. The extreme cold in late January killed most of the flower buds, and those in bloom will likely lose flowers due to cold this weekend.

The plant gets its name from the stinky odor it emits to attract pollinators like flies and gnats. It is also one of only a few plants that generates its own heat to melt away surrounding snow—a process called thermogenesis.

The gall provides shelter and food for the larva through the winter until it emerges as an adult fly in the spring.
